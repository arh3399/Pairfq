Revision history for Pairfq

Version	Date	Location
0.07	1/27/2014	Athens, GA

Remove use of DB_File. Reasons: 1) I discovered it has
only been a core module since v5.16 (I think, at least it was
not in v5.14.2). 2) It is much, much slower than BerkeleyDB and
less powerful in terms of features.

This was the source of much frustration and failure trying to get
everything to work in cases where DB_File was present, or BerkeleyDB
was present, or neither. The best solution was simply to install 
BerkeleyDB during the build process and forget about using DB_File
because it is quite slow and may not be available anyway (as I'd
assumed since I as using v5.18 -- and that's what the Perl docs describe).

0.06	1/25/2014	Athens, GA

Added support for using BerkeleyDB if it is available, 
but falling back to using DB_File for indexing method.

0.05	1/22/2014	Athens, GA

Enhancements: 1) Make in-memory processing default instead of
optional. This should be the expected behavior and is most used, 
so is a better default. 

2) Make --index an option instead of this being the default. 
This makes the code much more expressive now by checking if the 
index option is defined, instead of seeing if the memory option 
is not defined.

3) Add explicit exit or return from subroutines so it is clear
to anyone wanting to contribute what the flow of execution is 
for each method.

4) More sig handlers for indexing method to clean up index.

0.04	11/18/2013	Athens, GA

Bug fix for taking positional arguments (options were not
being recognized correctly). Add option to get version, for 
testing or general use.

0.03	11/18/2013	Athens, GA

Bug fixes for splitting pairs, storing files in memory,
and naming DBM files. Update/add tests.

0.02	11/11/2013	Athens, GA	

Removed all utility scripts and rolled methods into a single
executable. Completely redesigned pairfq to work as an application
with numerous methods, instead of a single script for just pairing
reads.

Make individual methods positional arguments instead of options. Fix
formatting of output and add time/version stamp.

0.01	11/01/2013	Athens, GA

Initial release.
