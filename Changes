Revision history for Pairfq

Version	Date	Location
0.04	11/18/2013	Athens, GA

Bug fix for taking positional arguments (options were not
being recognized correctly). Add option to get version, for 
testing or general use.

0.03	11/18/2013	Athens, GA

Bug fixes for splitting pairs, storing files in memory,
and naming DBM files. Update/add tests.

0.02	11/11/2013	Athens, GA	

Removed all utility scripts and rolled methods into a single
executable. Completely redesigned pairfq to work as an application
with numerous methods, instead of a single script for just pairing
reads.

Make individual methods positional arguments instead of options. Fix
formatting of output and add time/version stamp.
