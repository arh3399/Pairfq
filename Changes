Revision history for Pairfq

Version	Date	Location
0.05	1/22/2014	Athens, GA

Enhancements. 1) Make in-memory processing default instead of
optional. This should be the expected behavior and is most used, 
so is a better default. 

2) Make --index an option instead of this being the default. 
This makes the code much more expressive now by checking if the 
index option is defined, instead of seeing if the memory option 
is not defined.

3) Add explicit exit or return from subroutines so it is clear
to anyone wanting to contribute what the flow of execution is 
for each method.

4) More sig handlers for indexing method to clean up index.

0.04	11/18/2013	Athens, GA

Bug fix for taking positional arguments (options were not
being recognized correctly). Add option to get version, for 
testing or general use.

0.03	11/18/2013	Athens, GA

Bug fixes for splitting pairs, storing files in memory,
and naming DBM files. Update/add tests.

0.02	11/11/2013	Athens, GA	

Removed all utility scripts and rolled methods into a single
executable. Completely redesigned pairfq to work as an application
with numerous methods, instead of a single script for just pairing
reads.

Make individual methods positional arguments instead of options. Fix
formatting of output and add time/version stamp.
